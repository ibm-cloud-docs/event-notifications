Access to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} takes place over HTTPS and uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt data in transit.

For more information on supported TLS ciphers, see [TLS cipher support](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-cipher-support).

If you attempt to use a cipher that is not on this list, you may experience connectivity issues. Update your client to use one of the supported ciphers. If you are using `openssl`, you can use the command `openssl ciphers -v` at the command line (or for some installations of `openssl`, use the `-s -v` options) to show a verbose list of what ciphers your client supports.
