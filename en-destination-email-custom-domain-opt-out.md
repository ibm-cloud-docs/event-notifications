# Custom Domain Email Opt-out functionality
{: #en-destinations-custom-domain-opt-out}

{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} offers users a versatile option to deviate from the conventional subscription process by introducing an opt-out capability. This feature empowers users to seamlessly send notifications, allowing them to specify their preferred email addresses and templates within the send notifications payload. This not only simplifies the notification process but also elevates user control over their communication preferences.

It's worth noting that the opting-out functionality is not activated by default, and this deliberate choice is rooted in security considerations. Enabling the opt-out feature from the start helps prevent potential fraudulent activities and aids in the detection of unauthorized actions. This proactive security measure not only safeguards user data but also contributes to the overall protection of users' reputation as senders. By taking a cautious approach, {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} prioritizes security, ensuring a secure and trustworthy communication environment for its users.

## Requesting for the Opt Out feature for the Custom Domain Email destination
{: #en-destinations-custom-email-opt-out-request}

By default, the subscription flow seamlessly includes the custom domain email destination, providing users with a streamlined experience. However, for those who prefer to opt out, we have implemented a straightforward process. Users can access this option by completing a brief questionnaire that helps customize their email preferences.

This questionnaire ensures that users have the flexibility to tailor their subscription experience according to their specific needs. While the default setting optimizes convenience, the opt-out questionnaire empowers users to make personalized choices, enhancing their control over communication. This user-centric approach aligns with our commitment to providing a customizable and user-friendly platform.

1. Will the nature of the email content be Marketing or Transactional?

2. What is your website's URL?

3. Explain how you plan to use IBM Cloud Event Notifications to send email. To help us process your request, you should answer the following questions:

  a. What is your strategy for creating or obtaining your email subscriber list?

  b. What is your approach to managing bounced emails and handling recipient complaints?

  c. What methods do you have in place for recipients to unsubscribe from your email communications?

Add a statement that you agree to have an “unsubscribe” link in the email payload that you send.
