# Working with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Resource lifecycle events
{: #en-resource-lifecycle-events}

{{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service uses the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform for authentication, access, self-service instance creation, metering, and billing.
{: shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provisioning layer manages the lifecycle of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. A *resource* is anything that you can create from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog that is managed by and contained within a resource group.

Resource lifecycle events are events around the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources. For more information, see [Creating resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-manage_resource&interface=ui){: external}.

Some example of Resource lifecycle events are:

- Creating a resource instance
- Updating a resource instance
- Deleting a resource instance
- Service key credentials updates
- Resource groups updates

## Enabling resource lifecycle events
{: #en-enabling-resource-lifecycle-events}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Resource lifecycle events is a pre-defined source which publishes resource lifecycle events from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Resource lifecycle events is *Disabled* by default. You can go to the **Sources** page and enable it by using the toggle switch.

After enabling the source, you can publish the lifecycle events to the [Topic](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-about#en-topics) of your choice.

To learn more about working with **Topics**, see [here](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-create-en-topic).
