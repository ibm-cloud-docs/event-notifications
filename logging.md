# Logging for {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}
{: #logging}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} services, such as {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}, generate platform logs that you can use to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions in your account, and troubleshoot problems.
{: shortdesc}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}}, a platform service, to route platform logs in your account to a destination of your choice by configuring a tenant that defines where platform logs are sent. For more information, see [About Logs Routing](/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-about).

You can use {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to visualize and alert on platform logs that are generated in your account and routed by {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} to an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

As of 28 March 2024, the {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} service is deprecated and will no longer be supported as of 30 March 2025. Customers will need to migrate to {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} before 30 March 2025. During the migration period, customers can use {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} along with {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}. Logging is the same for both services. For information about migrating from {{site.data.keyword.la_full_notm}} to {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} and running the services in parallel, see [migration planning](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-migration-intro).

## Enabling logging
{: #log-enable}

Platform logs are logs that are exposed by logging-enabled services and the platform in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can configure {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} logs instance to receive the logs sent by service. See [{{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}}](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-getting-started) for more information.

## Viewing logs
{: #logging_view-old}

To view and analyze platform logs for an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance, check that the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} instance is provisioned and target is set for the same region where the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance that you want to monitor is available.
{: note}

To start the {{site.data.keyword.logs_routing_full_notm}} web UI to view logs, see [Navigating to the web UI](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-instance-launch).
