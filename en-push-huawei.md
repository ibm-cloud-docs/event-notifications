If you already have an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance, navigate to your {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance from the **Resource list** and select the required {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance. Otherwise, you can [create a new {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-getting-started#en-cloud-ac).

1. Click `Destinations` in the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} console. By default, **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} SMS service** and **{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Email service** are included, with their `Destination ID`.

You can upgrade a **Pre-production destination** to **Production destination** after creating the destination by using the **Edit** option from the overflow menu post your development and testing. For more information, see [Upgrading a Pre-production destination to Production destination](#en-destination-preprod-prod1). There will be change in cost when you upgrade.
