# Getting help and support for {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}
{: #en-getting-help-and-support}

{{site.data.keyword.en_full}} provides troubleshooting information to isolate and resolve problems, and also offers support. If you cannot resolve your issue with the troubleshooting guide, open an IBM support case.
{: shortdesc}

By default, account users don't have access to create, update, search, or view cases. The account owner must provide users access by assigning an {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM) access policy. For more information, see [Assigning user access for working with support cases](/docs/account?topic=account-access-cases){: external}.

{: #ac-ui-support-case}

Collecting the following information can help a faster support case resolution for UI issues

- Provide error codes and reference IDs.
- Save the full URL of the console when the problem occurred, for example: `https://cloud.ibm.com/event-notifications/provision/ac`
- Include the steps to reproduce the issue, along with your inputs and expected outputs.
- Note the approximate time that the error occurred.
- Provide the code version and error details:
   1. Right-click on the console page and select the `Inspect` or `Inspect Element` option.
   1. Scroll to the end of the output and copy any errors or stack traces.
- Provide the network response:
   1. While you inspect the page, click the `Network` tab.
   1. Refresh the page and reproduce the problem.
   1. Starting at the end of the list, click each request and view the `Preview` tab. If the request has an "errors" node, expand that node to show the full error.
   1. Click the `Response` tab and include the full response string and the URL that generated the response.
