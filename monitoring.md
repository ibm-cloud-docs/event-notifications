# Monitoring metrics for {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}
{: #monitoring}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services, such as {{site.data.keyword.en_full}}, generate platform metrics that you can use to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of the service in your account.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} is a third-party cloud-native, and container-intelligence management system that can be included as part of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} architecture. It offers administrators, DevOps teams, and developers full-stack telemetry with advanced features to monitor and troubleshoot, define alerts, and design custom dashboards. For more information, see [Monitoring in IBM Cloud](/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-about-monitor).

You can use {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}}, a platform service, to route platform metrics in your account to a destination of your choice by configuring targets and routes that define where platform metrics are sent. For more information, see [About {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-about).

You can use {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} to visualize and alert on metrics that are generated in your account and routed by {{site.data.keyword.metrics_router_full_notm}} to an {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance.

## Locations where metrics are generated
{: #mon-locations}

{{site.data.keyword.en_full}} sends metrics in the regions that are indicated in the following table.

| Dallas (`us-south`) | Washington (`us-east`)  | Toronto (`ca-tor`) | Sao Paulo (`br-sao`) |

## Enabling platform metrics for {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}
{: #monitoring-enable}

Before you can start with {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} monitoring metrics, you must first opt in and [enable platform metrics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-platform_metrics_enabling).
{: note}

You can configure only one instance of the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service per region to collect platform metrics.

- To configure the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance, you must turn on the platform metrics configuration setting.
- If a monitoring instance in a region is already enabled to collect platform metrics, metrics from enabled-monitoring services are collected automatically and available for monitoring through this instance. For more information about enabled-monitoring services, see {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} services.

To monitor platform metrics, check that the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} instance is created in the same region where the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} instance is created.
{: note}

## Viewing metrics
{: #monitoring-view}

To monitor {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} metrics, you must launch the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} web UI for the instance that is enabled for platform metrics in the region where your service instance is created.
