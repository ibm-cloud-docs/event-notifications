# Creating an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} subscription
{: #en-create-en-subscription}

Destinations subscribe to topics. Multiple destinations can subscribe to a single topic. An email subscription is a list of all emails IDs, and an SMS subscription is a list of all phone numbers that a notification is routed to. A webhook subscription links a webhook destination to a topic.

- You can add up to 3 phone numbers for the lite plan, and 100 phone numbers for standard plan to the recipient list. 
- When you click **Create** subscription after adding the phone numbers, the numbers are added to the **Invited** tab. The **Active** tab, displays the phone number of recipients who confirmed receiving SMS notifications for the topic that is selected in the invite.
- When a recipient clicks the **Unsubscribe** link, the recipients number is moved to the **Unsubscribed** tab. To restart the subscription, the recipient should contact {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service administrator to add the number back to the subscription.
- Sometimes, the carrier service allows keywords like `START` and `STOP`. When a recipient sends a response `STOP`, the services for recipient are disabled immediately. However, the phone number is moved to the **Unsubscribed** tab only on the next attempt to send an SMS to the same number. The recipient can restart to receive the SMS by sending a response code `START`.
