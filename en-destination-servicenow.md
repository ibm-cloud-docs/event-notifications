# ServiceNow
{: #en-destinations-servicenow}

A ServiceNow represents a service destination, where an incoming security event notification can be consumed programmatically to actions.
{: shortdesc}

An event which is routed to a ServiceNow destination will trigger creation of an Incident in the configured ServiceNow destination.
{: important}

## Configuring a ServiceNow destination
{: #en-sn-configure-destination}

The ServiceNow name follows the standard `https://xxx.service-now.com`, where `xxx` is your instance name. The ServiceNow instance name, Username, and Password can be fetched from your ServiceNow console. Navigate to your ServiceNow profile and go to **Manage Instance Password** to get the details.
{: important}

To configure a ServiceNow destination, do the following steps:

1. From your {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance dashboard, click **Destinations**.

1. Click **Add +** to add a new destination.

1. In the **Add a destination** side panel, provide the following details.

   - **Name** - Enter a name for your destination.
   - **Description** - Optionally, enter a description for your destination.
   - **Type** - Under **Destination**, for the **Type**, select **ServiceNow** from the drop-down as your destination type.
   - **Instance Name** - Enter the name of your ServiceNow instance.
   - **Username** - Enter the username to be used for connecting to the ServiceNow instance.
   - **Password** - Enter the password to be used for authenticating the username mentioned earlier to authenticate in the ServiceNow instance.
   - **Namespace** defaulting to `now` and it cannot be changed.
   - {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} currently allows creation of entries on "Incident" table only and it cannot be changed.
   - **URL** gets populated based on the value provided before.
   - **Client ID** - Enter the client ID needed to retrieve the OAuth access token.
   - **Client secret** - Enter the client secret required for authenticating the Client ID provided earlier.

      **Client ID** and **Client secret** can be fetched from `System Oauth` -> `Application Registries`. This is inside your ServiceNow instance console (you can search by clicking on "All"). Make sure it is in active state and applicable for connecting to external clients.
      {: note}

1. Click **Add**.

## Testing a ServiceNow destination configuration
{: #en-sn-test-destination}

You can test a ServiceNow destination in the options menu provided against the destination. You can effortlessly test a destination, whether the provided configuration is correct or not with a single click.

For more information on testing a destination, see [Testing Destinations](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-test-destination).

## ServiceNow retry policy
{: #en-sn-retry}

When calling a webhook, issues such as network errors and application glitches can cause the requests to fail. A retry is used to provide resiliency to external requests. Attempt to retry the requests in such situations by using the following values:

- Limit = 60 seconds: total time that the service retries.
- Step = 5 seconds: after each failure, the service waits 5 seconds before retrying. This delay prevents bombarding of the external services (webhook).

In addition, the following timeout conditions cause the ServiceNow call to fail:

- A connection timeout of 10 seconds
- A response timeout of 60 seconds

If a call to the ServiceNow webhook URL fails even after retry attempts, the notification is lost.
