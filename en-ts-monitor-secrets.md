## How {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} sends events
{: #tutorial-en-how-send}

When an event of interest takes place in your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance, it communicates with a connected {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} instance to forward a notification to a [Supported destination](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-destination).

This tutorial shows you how to configure the following flow:

1. An alert is raised in {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}.

1. {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} sends a notification to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}.

1. {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} creates an email and sends the email to the subscribed user.

Secrets Manager aggregates a list of your pending notifications by [event type](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-event-notifications&interface=ui#event-notifications-list), the type of secret, and expiry details if they apply. Every few minutes, the service checks for and dispatches any pending notifications to the connected {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service. For example, you might receive notifications that are similar to the following messages:

- You have five public certificate secrets that expire in 10 days.
- You have 100 imported certificate secrets that expire in 30 days.

You can be notified of a maximum 100 secrets in a single event notification.
