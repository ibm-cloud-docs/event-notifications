# Event source
{: #en-source}

A service or application on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} that emits event notifications and publishes them to a topic within the {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service. A source is a registered entity in an {{site.data.keyword.en_short}} service instance. Several services on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} are set to be integrated to send notifications to {{site.data.keyword.en_short}}.
IBM Monitoring is enabled, while  {{site.data.keyword.compliance_long}}, and {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_full_notm}} are in the pipeline. A source can publish to multiple topics. In, other contexts sources are identified as producers or publishers.
