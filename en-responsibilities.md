If you need zero downtime during a regional disaster recovery, create and maintain backup instances in other regions. Review the API documentation and decide the data that you want backed up and restored if there is a disaster. To synchronize a service instance in one region with an instance in a different region, you can use the APIs mentioned [here](/apidocs/event-notifications).

Some API examples are as follows:

|Entity   | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| sources | `/v1/instances/{instance_id}/sources` | Your platform sources |
| topics | `/v1/instances/{instance_id}/topics` | All registered topics |
| destinations | `/v1/instances/{instance_id}/destinations` | All registered destinations |
| subscriptions | `/v1/instances/{instance_id}/subscriptions` | All the subscriptions |
{: caption="Example API endpoints" caption-side="top"}

For each data set that you need to back up and restore, use `GET` calls to get a copy of the data. And use the corresponding `PUT / POST API` to populate the new instance on a different region.
