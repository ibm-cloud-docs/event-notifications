## Testing a Microsoft&trade; Teams destination configuration
{: #en-msteams-test-destination}

You can test a Microsoft&trade; Teams destination in the options menu provided against the destination. You can effortlessly test a destination, whether the provided configuration is correct or not with a single click.

For more information on testing a destination, see [Testing Destinations](/docs/event-notifications?topic=event-notifications-en-test-destination).


## Microsoft Teams retry policy
{: #en-msteams-retry}

When publishing an Microsoft Teams notification, issues such as network errors and application glitches can cause the requests to fail. A retry is used to provide resiliency to external requests. Attempt to retry the requests in such situations by using the following values:

- Limit = 60 seconds: total time that the service retries.
- Step = 5 seconds: after each failure, the service waits 5 seconds before retrying. This delay prevents bombarding of the external services (webhook).

In addition, the following timeout conditions cause the Microsoft Teams call to fail:

- A connection timeout of 10 seconds
- A response timeout of 60 seconds

If a call to the Microsoft Teams webhook URL fails even after retry attempts, the notification is lost.
